### A little about me 

Originally from New Zealand, I moved to Melbourne, Australia in 2018. I live here with my wife and child.

As a software developer: 

I'm JavaScript/TypeScript/modern web developer. 

A lot of my focus is around testability and developer experience. 'How do we design this component such that it's testable?', 'How do we make it easy for developers to do the right thing?'. 

Some of my hobbies are: 

- Board games
- Pinball
- Reading - mostly Science fiction and fantasy, also political theory, though I often find it a bit dense. 
- Painting miniatures
- Typewriters (I own 11 at time of writing, of those five are in a state of disrepair)
- Flying kites.
